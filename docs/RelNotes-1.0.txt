==================
v1.0 Release Notes
==================

* new options to query information from a deck::

 --isdeck              test if path is a deck
 --get-fstab           print fstab of deck
 --get-level=INDEX     print path of deck level
                       INDEX := <integer> | first | last

 --isdirty             test if deck is dirty
 --ismounted           test if deck is mounted

* renamed -d option to -D (safer)

* bugfixes

  - we only need to clone last level if the deck is dirty

  - if any umount fails, remount everything

    the state of a deck after a failed umount should be the same as
    before the umount was attempted.

  - deck doesn't see mounts made inside the chroot

    Previously Mounts() were read from either /etc/mtab or /proc/mounts.
    If you mounted a device from inside the chroot then /etc/mtab would
    not be updated in the parent.
  
    Solution: by default, Mounts() merges information from /etc/mtab and
    /proc/mounts, with priority given to /etc/mtab because it contains
    more information.

  - fixed anoncache blob id sanity checking

* packaging changes

  - added short description to debian/control
  - added useraufs dependency

* use gnu_getopt instead of getopt

* porting to pyproject 1.0

* minor refactorings
